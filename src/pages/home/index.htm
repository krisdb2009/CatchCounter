    <h1>Saves ice! No need to re-count the catch! A GREAT FISH COUNTER!</h1>
    <p>Hello,</p><br>

    <p>My name is Tony Sebastiano. I live in Northern Ohio, on the west end of Lake Erie with my family. I came up with this idea  while enjoying a day of fishing on Beautiful Lake Erie. My product is named “CatchCounter”, and is a device that automatically keeps and accurate count of fish that have been caught. Catch Counter is a conservation tool and a “Green” device. Sustainability of Fishery Resources is a worldwide problem today. Inland and near shore marine fisheries are maintained by State or County Fisheries Commission. These agencies control fish populations by protecting areas and fishing seasons and also by individual fishing quotas or limits. Worldwide, countries are imposing limits on catches as we begin to realize the need to manage all Fisheries. “CatchCounter” was born from this“Green” idea of keeping an easy and accurate count of fish caught and by doing that stay within Government limits of that particular species.
    </p>
    <p>“CatchCounter” works by Mounting it on some sort of container. Usually mounted on a Cooler or Icebox, a Livewell or Bucket lid. Simple to use, just drop the fish through the chute and the fish is counted. The old way to count fish is to either keep a count in your head or use a hand tally counter.
    </p>
    <p>The problem with both of these methods is that you sometimes forget to count or click and often end up with more fish than you are allowed. So before going anywhere you always had to re-count the total catch by hand and throw away any extra fish to avoid a Fine by Government Agents. Discarding dead fish is not good for Conservation or a Green Planet. “CatchCounter” eliminates all of these steps while making the Fishing experience easier and less stressful.
    </p>
    <p>Charter Boat Captains and Recreational Boaters love this idea as it is so hard to keep a good count with so many people on board. Government Fines for over limit catches range from $50.00 to loss of equipment, including your boat, and jail time. Fish are a very serious business.
